In this part we present our main results.
In !chapterRef(Special)(Polynomials) we introduce equivalence of terms w.r.t. the axioms of associative commutative algebras.
In !chapterRef(Special)(ProductRules) we define special product rules,
and in !chapterRef(Special)(Products) we show that special product rules induce associative commutative series algebras.
In !chapterRef(Special)(Automata) we show that `P`-automata are compatible with equivalence of terms when `P` is a special product rule.

Finally, in !chapterRef(Special)(Reversal) we apply special product rules to right derivatives and the reversal operation.
